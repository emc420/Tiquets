# Tiquets

We have exported 2 datasets from our system, one contains orders from customers and
another contains barcodes (with an order_id if they are sold).
To print the Tiqets vouchers we need a csv file with all the barcodes and orders_ids per
customer.

Write a program that reads these two files, orders.csv and barcodes.csv, and generates an
output file that contains the following data:
customer_id, order_id1, [barcode1, barcode2, ...]
customer_id, order_id2, [barcode1, barcode2, ...]

Bonus points:
    ● We want to have the top 5 customers that bought the most amount of tickets.
    The script should print (to stdout) the top 5 customers of the dataset. Each line
    should be in the following format:
    customer_id, amount_of_tickets
    ● Print the amount of unused barcodes (barcodes left).
    ● Model how you would store this in a SQL database (e.g. UML, data model with
    relations and optionally indexes)
    
Input files:
Two files in comma separated formatting.
orders.csv
order_id, customer_id
This contains a list of orders. order_id is unique.

barcodes.csv
barcode, order_id
The barcodes in our system. If a barcode has been sold, it’s assigned to an order using
order_id, otherwise order_id is empty.

Validation:
Make sure the input is validated correctly:
  ● No duplicate barcodes
  ● No orders without barcodes
  Items which failed the validation should be logged (e.g. stderr) and ignored for the output.
  Requirements:
  ● Write your solution in Python
  ● Deliver solution using git or a zip file.
